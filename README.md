# AI Deal & Negotiation Simulator

**A powerful AI Agent built with n8n to automate deal negotiation and decision-making workflows**

---

## **🚀 Project Overview**

**AI Deal & Negotiation Simulator** is an intelligent, fully automated agent designed to analyze, evaluate, and negotiate deals using **n8n** and AI models such as **OpenAI GPT / Gemini**.

This project demonstrates how  can create professional-grade AI workflows that combine **automation, decision-making, and AI integration**, without the need for a team or complex infrastructure.

## **✨ Key Features**

* **Intelligent Deal Evaluation:** AI Agent analyzes deals and recommends the best course of action.
* **Workflow Automation with n8n:** Modular and easily extendable workflows for various use cases.
* **Solo Developer Friendly:** Fully functional as a personal project, no complex setup required.
* **Automated Notifications:** Receive results via email, Telegram, or save to JSON files.
* **Ready-to-Use JSON Workflows:** Import directly into n8n and start running immediately.
